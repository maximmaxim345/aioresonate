## Quick Summary

### Race Conditions Found

| ID | Component | Severity | Issue |
|----|-----------|----------|-------|
| **RC-1** | Client | HIGH | Non-atomic connected property check |
| **RC-2** | Client | HIGH | Reader loop duplicate disconnect calls |
| **RC-3** | Client | MEDIUM | Callbacks cleared while invoked |
| **RC-4** | Client | MEDIUM | Send after disconnect - stale reference |
| **RC-5** | Client | LOW | Send to disconnected socket |
| **RC-6** | Client | MEDIUM | Time filter concurrent read/write |
| **RC-7** | Server Client | HIGH | Multiple concurrent disconnect calls |
| **RC-8** | Server Client | MEDIUM | Task reference race |
| **RC-9** | Server Connection | HIGH | Non-atomic check-and-create |
| **RC-10** | Server Connection | MEDIUM | Stale event reference |

### Critical Issues (Must Fix Immediately)

- **RC-1**: `/home/user/aioresonate/aioresonate/client/client.py:238-240, 685`
  - Non-atomic property checks return inconsistent results
  - Causes stale WebSocket references and continued operation after disconnect

- **RC-2**: `/home/user/aioresonate/aioresonate/client/client.py:412-423, 282-313`
  - Reader loop and external disconnect race for same cleanup code
  - Results in skipped or duplicated cleanup operations

- **RC-7**: `/home/user/aioresonate/aioresonate/server/client.py:168-200`
  - Multiple concurrent disconnect paths without atomicity
  - Callbacks invoked multiple times, group state corrupted

- **RC-9**: `/home/user/aioresonate/aioresonate/server/server.py:150-170`
  - Check and create operations not atomic
  - Task leaks, orphaned connections, resource leaks

### Affected Files

**Primary Files** (need fixes):
- `aioresonate/client/client.py` - 6 race conditions
- `aioresonate/server/server.py` - 2 race conditions
- `aioresonate/server/client.py` - 2 race conditions
- `aioresonate/client/time_sync.py` - 1 race condition

**Related Files** (affected by RC-7):
- `aioresonate/server/group.py`
- `aioresonate/server/player.py`

## Root Causes

1. **No Synchronization Primitives** - No locks protecting shared state
2. **Multiple Disconnect Paths** - No single entry point for disconnect
3. **Task Lifetime Issues** - Tasks referenced after cleanup
4. **State Distribution** - Connection state scattered across variables
5. **Event Reference Issues** - Long-lived references to deleted events

## How to Use This Analysis

### For Developers Implementing Fixes

1. Start with **RACE_CONDITION_ANALYSIS.md** for overview
2. Read specific section for your target race condition
3. Review **RACE_CONDITION_DETAILS.md** for execution timeline
4. Check line numbers in source files for exact locations
5. Use reproduction steps to verify your fix

### For Code Reviewers

1. Skim **RACE_CONDITION_ANALYSIS.md** quick reference table
2. Focus on sections matching your component
3. Verify proposed fixes address the specific race condition
4. Check that new code includes proper synchronization

### For QA/Testing

1. Review reproduction steps in **RACE_CONDITION_DETAILS.md**
2. Use test scenarios to verify race conditions exist
3. Verify fixes prevent reproduction of race conditions
4. Add concurrent/stress tests to prevent regression

---

## Key Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (CRITICAL)

1. **Implement locks** for shared state access
2. **Make disconnect() atomic** - prevent concurrent calls
3. **Fix connected property** - make checks atomic
4. **Protect connect_to_client()** - implement atomic check-and-create

### Short-term (HIGH)

1. Add locks to time filter for concurrent access
2. Protect callback access with synchronization
3. Fix event reference lifecycle
4. Add comprehensive tests for concurrent scenarios

### Testing

1. Add tests for concurrent disconnect calls
2. Test rapid connect/disconnect cycles
3. Test callback invocation during disconnect
4. Test multiple connect() calls to same URL
5. Stress test with high message volume

## Timeline

- **RC-1 & RC-2**: Direct impact on client disconnect/reconnect
- **RC-3 to RC-6**: Progressive severity, affect specific code paths
- **RC-7**: Direct impact on server-side client management
- **RC-8 & RC-9**: Connection lifecycle and resource management
- **RC-10**: Less common but still critical for retry logic

## Additional Notes

- This analysis focuses on **asyncio race conditions** (not threading)
- Uses Python 3.7+ async/await syntax
- All race conditions are **observable and reproducible** with proper timing
- Fixes should preserve existing API contracts

## Questions or Updates?

If you identify new race conditions or need clarification on existing ones:

1. Reference the specific RC-X number
2. Include timeline showing the race
3. Provide code location (file:line)
4. Describe observed impact
